Open this folder in VS Code.

A markdown file is a text file that uses markup syntax to add formatting and structure to the text. It is often used to create documentation.
Throughout the challenges, we will be using markdown files to describe what needs to be completed. You can find a markdown file in each challenge folder.

You can view the source code of the markdown file by opening the file. By selecting the preview button you can view the compiled document.

Since you'll be reading markdown files instead of writing them most of the time it might be useful to change the default behaviour to preview mode.

Go to settings -> workbench -> editor associations and add the following: \*.md | vscode.markdown.preview.editor

Mardown files are now openend in preview instead of source code by default.
