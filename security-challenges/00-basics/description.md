# Security Basics

## 1. Prerequisites

One of the platforms offering free and interactive security challenges is "Try Hack Me" (but others exist too, like Hack The Box). Create a free account on the www.tryhackme.com platform.


## 2. Introduction

Thoughout these challenges we will introduce you to the field of cyber security. In order to understand the field of cyber security, you need to be familiar with some basic concepts. These concepts will be built upon or explored even more in other courses during your bachelor's program. Make sure you understand them well and success is in your hands!

## 3. Challenge

Complete the following free rooms on "Try Hack Me": 
- https://tryhackme.com/room/securityawarenessintro 
- https://tryhackme.com/room/principlesofsecurity

Create a textfile solution.txt in the directory of this file. Answer the following questions (a new line for each answer) and push your solution to your GitHub repository:

1. What website is useful to know about when checking if your account (and possibly the password for it) might have been leaked through a data breach? (format: xxx.com, so no "https" or "www" or whatsoever in front of the URL)

2. What famous hackers collective has been in the news many times already? Their logo has been used in many movies and tv shows too. (format: xxx)

3. What type of motivation is behind this collective? (format: xxx)

Your textfile should contain 3 lines.

## 4. General rules

In order to get a "SUCCESS" from the verify script, you will need to make sure that:

-   You have followed the instructions exactly as described in the text. Do not put extra text in files or create extra folders unless asked to do so.
-   Assume that the verify script is case-sensitive. Pay attention to the exact naming of files and folders.
-   Never make changes to the verify script (yes, we will verify all verify scripts afterwards). Changes to the verify script will result in a "FAIL" for the entire challenge.
-   You will only receive a "SUCCESS" if you complete all the steps successfully. If you only complete part of the challenge steps, you will receive a "FAIL" for the entire challenge.
